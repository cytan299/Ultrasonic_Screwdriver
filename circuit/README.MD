# Ultrasonic Screwdriver schematic diagram

This is the schematic diagrams of the Ultrasonic Screwdriver and
charging circuit in Fritzing-like format. The [bill of materials
(BOM)](https://github.com/cytan299/Ultrasonic_Screwdriver/tree/main/bom)
file contains the parts that were used.

## Upgrade to v2

In v1, it is very clumsy to charge the Ultrasonic Screwdriver because
the bottom cover has to be unscrewed to reveal a charging plug. The
plug is then attached to the Charging Stand's socket for charging.  In
the upgraded version 2, the Ultrasonic Screwdriver can be charged by
inserting it into the Charging Stand.

These diagrams contain both the v1 and v2 circuits.
