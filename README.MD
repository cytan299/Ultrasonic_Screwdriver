# Ultrasonic Screwdriver

by C.Y. Tan 2023


The Ultrasonic Screwdriver is built in the spirit of a Dr Who Sonic
Screwdriver. I made this screw driver that actually does actual, real
measurements rather than simply a prop.

I my desing, the heart of the ultrasonic screwdriver is the [ESP32-S3 reverse TFT
Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5691) made by Adafruit. The
ESP32-S3 contains dual cores running at 240 MHz and it  has 4 MB Flash
and 2 MB PSRAM of memory. Adafruit has added a colour 1.14 inch TFT
with 240x130 pixels.
