# Ultrasonic Screwdriver -- An improved DIY homemade Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver

by C.Y. Tan 2023


The Ultrasonic Screwdriver is an improved DIY homemade Doctor Who Sonic
Screwdrivers. I made this screwdriver that does actual, real
measurements rather than simply performing as a prop.

In my design, the heart of the Ultrasonic Screwdriver is the [ESP32-S3
reverse TFT Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5691) made by
Adafruit. The ESP32-S3 contains dual cores running at 240 MHz with 4
MB Flash and 2 MB PSRAM of memory. Adafruit also added a colour 1.14
inch TFT display with 240x130 pixels. This makes the ESP32-S3 reverse
TFT Feather the ideal platform for the Ultrasonic Screwdriver because
it has enough horsepower and I/O to host multiple devices.  The
devices that the Ultrasonic Screwdriver contains are as follows:

* **Ultrasonic** range finder which makes it possible for me to call
  my screwdriver the Ultrasonic. The ultrasonic range finder is made
  by [MaxBotix](https://www.adafruit.com/product/983).
* **Torch** to light up the darkness or _alien dungeons_. Torch uses the [Neopixel 12x5050
  RGBW LEDs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2851).
* **Thermal camera** which measures the temperature of objects using
  IR. The thermal camera is made by
  [Melexis](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4469). _It's great for
  scanning hot alien devices_.
* **WIFI** scanner that uses the built in [WIFI circuitry](https://learn.adafruit.com/esp32-s3-reverse-tft-feather/wifi-test) in the
  ESP32-S3 to _scan the air for alien radio transmissions_.
* **IR TV transmitter** uses the [RMT (remote control
  transceiver)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/rmt.html)
   built into the ESP32-S3 for controlling the TV using NEC codes. _Or
  to open alien doors_.
* **Sound** ESP32-S3 sends sound bytes to the [I2S 3W class D
  amplifer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3006) for sound
  generation.
* **Ultrasonic zapper** combines the ultrasonic range finder that
  transmits ultrasound at 42 kHz in free-run mode, the Neopixel Ring
  flashing rainbow colours and the Ultrasound Screwdriver sound to
  scare animals or _blow up Daleks_ :)
  
Like many Doctor Who sonic screwdrivers, the Ultrasonic Screwdriver can
also be flicked or slid open. Unlike Doctor Who sonic screwdrivers that
_psychically_ connects with the Doctor, my rendition reveals the user
screen and control buttons after it is opened.

The only shortcoming of the Ultrasonic Screwdriver is that it does not
function as a screwdriver :)

And for completeness, I have also made a charging stand for the
Ultrasonic Screwdriver. It's a nice stand for the Ultrasonic
Screwdriver to rest and recharge.

## Directory structure

* **openscad** The program _sonic_case.scad_ that generates the STL files for making the
  shell of the Ultrasonic Screwdriver.
* **STL** The STL files that were generated by the
  _sonic_case.scad_ and _sonic_stand.scad_. These files are used to 3D
  print the sonic shell and its charging stand using
slicer programs like [Ultimaker CURA](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/).
* **ultrasonic_screwdriver** contains the ESP32-S3 source code that is
  compiled by the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
  and programmed  into the ESP32-S3.
* **laser_cut** contains my unique badge and top plate that has
  decorations written in
  [Gallifreyan](https://shermansplanet.com/gallifreyan/guide.pdf).
* **circuit** The Ultrasonic Screwdriver and charging stand connection circuits.
* **howto** contains the build guide.	
* **bom** contains the bill of materials spreadsheet that
partially lists the parts that I had used to build the screwdriver.
* **pics** contains photos used for describing this repository.

## Support

All the software have been successfully compiled with Arduino IDE 2.2.1.

This is unsupported software and hardware. Build at your own peril! :)
