# Partial List of Materials

The bill of materials (bom) spreadsheet that I have uploaded here is
only a partial list. I have only listed the major parts that I had
ordered from both [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) and
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com). 

The parts that are missing are:
* **Paints** I did not list the paints that I had used because that's really up to
you how you'd want to paint it. 
* **3D filaments** I also did not list the 3D filaments that I had used. It's your
preference what you'll use for your 3D printer. 
    * For your reference, for the "clear" cover, I printed it with
      _SUNLU clear PLA filament 1.75 mm_. 
* **Sundries** Other sundries like sandpaper, masking tape etc. are also not included.

The bom.ods file is readable using [LibreOffice Calc](http://www.libreoffice.org).
