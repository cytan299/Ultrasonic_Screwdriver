# Signature

The file
* **signature_single_v2.svg** contains the my signature written in
  [Gallifreyan](https://shermansplanet.com/gallifreyan/guide.pdf) that
  is laser cut and attached to the front of the Ultrasonic
  Screwdriver.
  
The _signature_single_v2.svg_ can be sent to a laser cutting vendor
like [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) for laser cutting. The material that I had used is 1.5 mm thick
_Brushed Copper on Black Two Color Acrylic_. 

You can personalize the signature by modifying the svg file and
then laser cutting it.
