# Top plate

The file
* **top_plate_ponoko1.svg** contains my unique top plate design written in
  [Gallifreyan](https://shermansplanet.com/gallifreyan/guide.pdf) that
  is laser cut and mounted to the top of the Ultrasonic
  Screwdriver charging stand.
  
The _top_plate_ponoko1.svg_ can be sent to a laser cutting vendor
like [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) for laser cutting. The material
that I had used is the 0.5 mm copper on black adhesive-backed plastic.

You can personalize the badge by modifying the svg file and
then laser cutting it.
