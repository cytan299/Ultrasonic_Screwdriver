# Badge

The file
* **badge_single_v2.svg** contains my unique badge design written in
  [Gallifreyan](https://shermansplanet.com/gallifreyan/guide.pdf) that
  is laser cut and mounted to the front of the Ultrasonic 
  Screwdriver and the charging stand.
  
The _badge_single_v2.svg_ can be sent to a laser cutting vendor
like [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) for laser cutting. The material that I had used is 1.5 mm thick
_Brushed Copper on Black Two Color Acrylic_. 

You can personalize the badge by modifying the svg file and
then laser cutting it.
