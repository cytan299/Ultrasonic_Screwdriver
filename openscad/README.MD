# OpenScad files

These [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/) files that generate all the [STL](https://github.com/cytan299/Ultrasonic_Screwdriver/tree/main/STL) files that are loaded into a slicer program like the  [Ultimaker CURA](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/) for 3D printing.

## Files
* **sonic_case.scad** The main file that generates nearly all parts of the Ultrasonic Screwdriver case.
* **push_button.scad** The pushbutton that allows the spring to allow the inner case structure of the Ultrasonic Screwdriver to slide.
* **spring.scad** is the spring mechanism that holds the inner case structure open when it is extended out of the outer case.
* **libscrew.scad** is the OpenScad [screw library](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1686322) written by R. Colyer. It is uploaded here for convenience.
