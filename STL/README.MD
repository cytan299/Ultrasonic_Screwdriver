# STL files

These STL files were created with [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/) from
the source code in
[openscad](https://github.com/cytan299/Ultrasonic_Screwdriver/tree/main/openscad). These
files are loaded into a slicer program like the [Ultimaker
CURA](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/) for 3D printing.

## Infill

It is interesting that the best setting that I have found for the infill is
zigzag and not cubic. I wanted a strong shell and so I had to set the
fill fraction to be 50%. You should check that zigzag and 50% fill
works for you by examining the generated cross sections in your slicer program.
