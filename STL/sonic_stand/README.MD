# Ultrasonic Screwdriver Charging Stand STL files

These STL files were created with [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/)
from the source code in
[openscad](https://github.com/cytan299/Ultrasonic_Screwdriver/tree/main/openscad/sonic_stand.scad). These
files are loaded into a slicer program like the [Ultimaker
CURA](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/) for 3D printing.

## Infill

Only top_plate_with_laser_plate.stl is printed with 10% gyroid with
transparent PLA. The remaining parts used an infill of 20% cubic. 

## Laser cut decoration

The laser cut decoration is in [laser_cut](https://github.com/cytan299/Ultrasonic_Screwdriver/tree/main/laser_cut)
