# Ultrasonic Screwdriver Charging Stand STL files

These STL files were created with [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/)
from the source code in
[openscad](https://github.com/cytan299/Ultrasonic_Screwdriver/tree/main/openscad/sonic_stand.scad). These
files are loaded into a slicer program like the [Ultimaker
CURA](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/) for 3D printing.

## Infill

Only top_plate_with_laser_plate.stl is printed with 10% gyroid with
transparent PLA. The remaining parts used an infill of 20% cubic. 

## Upgrade to v2

In v1, the Ultrasonic Screwdriver is charged unscrewing its base to
reveal a charging plug. The plug is then attached to the Charging
Stand's socket for charging. In the upgraded version 2, the Ultrasonic
Screwdriver can be charged by inserting it into the Charging
Stand. This upgrade will require the following new STL file for the
charging stand:

* **alignment_pegs.stl** This file contains the alignment pegs and the
  recess for the spring connector.

## Laser cut decoration

The laser cut decoration is in [laser_cut](https://github.com/cytan299/Ultrasonic_Screwdriver/tree/main/laser_cut)
